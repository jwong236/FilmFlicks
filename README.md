- **Styling:** Took charge of the overall styling for the webpages, ensuring a cohesive visual experience.
- **Database Design:** Created the SQL database schema which structures the entire database used for storing movie data.


### Project 2
#### Andy Phu
- **Login Feature Implementation:** Implemented the login feature using endpoints to manage user authentication.
- **Login Filter Development:** Developed a login filter to ensure authentication checks across protected endpoints.
- **Shopping Cart Functionality:** Implemented the shopping cart functionality using session management to track user cart data.

#### Jacob Wong
- **Frontend Webpages Creation:** Created the frontend webpages for Login, Homepage, MovieList, ShoppingCart, PaymentInfo, and Confirmation pages
- **Search and Browse Endpoints:** Wrote backend endpoints to support search and browse functionalities

#### LIKE Predicate
- **Usage:** In the servlet, the LIKE keyword is used with SQL queries to enable partial and case-insensitive searches for movie titles, directors, and stars. It allows users to find movies based on substrings, making the search feature flexible and user-friendly. Wildcards (%) are used with LIKE to match any sequence of characters before and after the search terms.

#### Connection Pooling

- **Include the filename/path of all code/configuration files in GitHub of using JDBC Connection Pooling:**
    - `META-INF/context.xml`
    - The following servlet files in `src/main/java/com/fabflix/servlets/`:
        - `Add.java`
        - `BrowseCharacter.java`
        - `BrowseGenre.java`
        - `CastInsert.java`
        - `Delete.java`
        - `DomParser.java`
        - `EmployeeLogin.java`
        - `EncryptPasswords.java`
        - `Login.java`
        - `Metadata.java`
        - `MovieInsert.java`
        - `Payment.java`
        - `PreviousGetter.java`
        - `Search.java`
        - `ShoppingCart.java`
        - `SingleMovie.java`
        - `SingleStar.java`
        - `StarInsert.java`
        - `Subtract.java`
        - `TopMovies.java`
        - `TotalPrice.java`
        - `FullTextSearch.java`

- **Explain how Connection Pooling is utilized in the Fabflix code:**
    - **Configuration in `context.xml`:**
      JDBC Connection Pooling is configured in the `META-INF/context.xml` file. This file contains the connection pooling settings, including the maximum number of connections (`maxTotal`), the maximum number of idle connections (`maxIdle`), and the maximum wait time for a connection (`maxWaitMillis`). The database URL, username, and password are specified in this file along with the `factory` attribute to use the `org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.DataSourceFactory`.
    - **Usage in Servlets:**
      Connection pooling is utilized across multiple servlets in the Fabflix application. Each servlet initializes the `DataSource` object in the `init` method by looking up the resource configured in `context.xml`. Here is an example from the `Search` servlet:
      ```java
      @WebServlet("/search")
      public class Search extends HttpServlet {
          private DataSource dataSource;
  
          @Override
          public void init(ServletConfig config) {
              try {
                  dataSource = (DataSource) new InitialContext().lookup("java:comp/env/jdbc/moviedb");
              } catch (NamingException e) {
                  e.printStackTrace();
              }
          }
  
          @Override
          protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
              try (Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection()) {
                  List<Movie> movies = searchMovies(connection, title, director, star, year, page, pageSize, sortRule);
                  response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_OK);
                  response.getWriter().println(new ObjectMapper().writeValueAsString(movies));
              } catch (SQLException e) {
                  response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
                  response.getWriter().println("{\"error\": \"Database error: " + e.getMessage() + "\"}");
              }
          }
      }
      ```
    - **Prepared Statements:**
      Prepared Statements are used in all database interactions involving user input to prevent SQL injection and improve performance. These statements are also optimized using the `cachePrepStmts=true` flag in the JDBC URL, which caches the prepared statements for reuse.

- **Explain how Connection Pooling works with two backend SQL:**
    - **Single Database Instance (Current Setup):**
      In the current Fabflix setup, JDBC Connection Pooling is configured to interact with a single MySQL database instance. All database interactions, including reads and writes, utilize the connection pool defined in the `META-INF/context.xml` file. This setup ensures efficient reuse of database connections and reduces the overhead associated with opening and closing connections.

#### Master/Slave
- **Include the filename/path of all code/configuration files in GitHub of routing queries to Master/Slave SQL:**
-context.xml
-web.xml

- **How read/write requests were routed to Master/Slave SQL?:**
- I made two different data sources in the context.xml and made sure for the servlets that wrote to use the writing resource.
